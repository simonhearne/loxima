Bluetooth beacons allow people with smartphones to interact with their immediate surroundings, this has potential for amazing user experiences.

Bluetooth beacons provide a _discovery mechanism_ for web applications, which is currently one of the biggest barriers to adoption of [Progressive Web Apps](/articles/the-death-of-apps/). Remy Sharp recently published a [blog post](https://remysharp.com/2016/04/11/the-webapp-discovery-problem) which argues that web apps _are_ discoverable - there is no friction from having to go to an app store and search for the app or even going to a web page and looking for the app install icon.

_Link_ discovery has evolved rapidly since the web was first switched on in the early '90s. From a hand-maintaened list of web servers, to [Facebook links](https://youtu.be/MUzRiCp23JM?t=29s) and [Twitter hashtags](https://youtu.be/7DdM-4siaQw?t=3m24s) in TV adverts, link discovery is always a problem. The solution is to either have a very memorable domain, or tell your customers to search for you. Neither of these work for deep-links and both require effort from the consumer.

[QR Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) help to bridge the link discovery divide - by allowing users to scan an image which can take them directly to a specified URL. This is ideal for deep-linking and rapid engagement, as well as location-based analytics (e.g. which bus stops should we continue to advertise on). Unfortunately there is western stigma about taking pictures in public, meaning that users are unlikely to interact with a QR Code in a public place and even becoming a [point of ridicule](https://qrcodefails.wordpress.com/).

[NFC tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) took this concept one step further, instead of having to use your device camera to scan a code, you can just hold the device within a centimetre and the link will appear. This technology also succumbed to the western stigma of holding your phone out in public and has, thus far, not taken off extensively.

Bluetooth beacons, then, are the ultimate form of localised link discovery. The link automatically appears in your notifications panel - no taking pictures or awkardly holding your phone against an advert. No-one could tell if you were reading the news or interacting with a beacon, stigma solved!
